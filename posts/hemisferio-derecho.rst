*This is perhaps the most beautiful time in human history;
 it is really pregnant with all kinds of creative possibilities made
possible
 by science and technology which now constitute the slave of man,
if man is not enslaved by it.*
`Jonas Salk <http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk>`_
No sólo de la técnica vive el hombre.
